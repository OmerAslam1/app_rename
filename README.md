## How To Rename ? ðŸ› 

##### 1) ADD THE PACKAGE TO DEPENDENCIES IN pubspec.yaml

flutter pub add app_rename
```

OR

```sh
dependencies:
  app_rename: ^latest_version
```

##### 2) PROVIDE THE APP NAME

You can provide app name in the following ways

##### Same name for all apps

```sh
flutter pub run app_rename:main all="My App Name"
```

##### Separate name for specified platform(s) and same for all others

```sh
flutter pub run app_rename:main android="Android Name" ios="IOS Name" others="Others Name"
```

##### Separate name for each platform

```sh
flutter pub run app_rename:main android="Android Name" ios="IOS Name" web="Web Name" mac="Mac Name" windows="Windows Name"
